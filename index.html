            <p>Modern web applications often contain three or more tiers, and depending on the size of the team a developer works on, he or she may specialize in one or more of these tiers - or may take a more interdisciplinary role. A web developer is usually classified as a Front-end web development or a Back-End Web Developer. For example, in a two-person team, one developer may focus on the technologies sent to the client such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, ReactJs or AngularJS and on the server-side frameworks (such as Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, ASP, ASP.NET, Node.js) used to deliver content and scripts to the client.</p>
